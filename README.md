Projects for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program

This course teaches machine learning fundamentals and includes doing projects with real-world data.

The following projects were completed as part of this course:

1. **Titanic Survival Exploration:** Exploring the 1912 Titanic dataset and using simple supervised learning algorithms to predict survival outcomes.
2. **Predict Boston Housing Prices:** Using supervised learning algorithms (Regression) to predict the prices of houses in Boston.
3. **Finding Donors for CharityML:** Using supervised learning algorithms (Classification) to create clusters of people who are most likely to donate to a fictitous charity called "CharityML".
4. **Creating Customer Segments:** Using PCA and dimensionality reduction to describe the types of customers a wholesale distributor interacts with.
5. **Train a Smartcab to Drive:** Using reinforcement learning algorithms (Q-learning) to teach a cab in a driving simulator how to navigate safely through traffic to a waypoint.
6. **Dog Breed Classifier:** Use Deep Learning techniques (Convolutional Neural Networks) to build a dog breed classifier.
7. **Capstone Project:** Use everything I learned to solve a problem of my choice. I decided to do a Kaggle competition titled "Personalized Medicine: Redefining Cancer Treament" where I applied machine learning techniques and neural networks to this natural language processing problem.
