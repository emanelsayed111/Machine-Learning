# Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project

## Kaggle Competition: 

For my MLND capstone project I chose to do the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment)
titled "Personalized Medicine: Redefining Cancer Treatment." The competition is about using natural language processing to determine
which class a piece of text (in this case medical liturature) belongs to. The class represents genetic mutations.
