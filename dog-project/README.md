# Dog Breed Classifier

This project used Deep Learning techniques (Convolutional Neural Networks) to build a dog breed classifier as part of the deep learning
section of the machine learning engineer nanodegree. Also used OpenCV to detect human faces in images and the number of faces. Also 
used transfer learning to train existing CNN architectures including ResNet-50, VGG16, and InceptionV3.
