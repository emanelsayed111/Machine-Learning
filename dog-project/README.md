# Dog Breed Classifier

This project used Deep Learning techniques (Convolutional Neural Networks) to build a dog breed classifier as part of the deep learning
section of the machine learning engineer nanodegree. The classifier takes in an image as input and predicts the breed of the dog (if a dog is detected). If a human face is detected, then the model predicts the dog breed that best resembles the human in the picture. Also used OpenCV to detect human faces in images as well as transfer learning to train existing CNN architectures including ResNet-50, VGG16, and InceptionV3.
